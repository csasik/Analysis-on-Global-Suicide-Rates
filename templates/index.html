								<h2  id="pub1"><strong>What Is Suicide?</strong> </h2>
								<p>Suicide is when people direct violence at themselves with the intent to end their lives, and they die because of their actions. It’s best to avoid the use of terms like “committing suicide” or a “successful suicide” when referring to a death by suicide as these terms often carry negative connotations.
									
									A suicide attempt is when people harm themselves with the intent to end their lives, but they do not die because of their actions.</p>

								   <h2  id="pub4"><strong>What Should I Do if I Am in Crisis or Someone I Know Is Considering Suicide? </strong> </h2>
								   <p>Often, family and friends are the first to recognize the warning signs of suicide and can take the first step toward helping an at-risk individual find treatment with someone who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. If someone is telling you that they are going to kill themselves, do not leave them alone. Do not promise anyone that you will keep their suicidal thoughts a secret. Make sure to tell a trusted friend or family member, or if you are a student, an adult with whom you feel comfortable. You can also contact the resources noted below.</p>
								   <h2  id="pub5"><strong>What if Someone Needs Help Online?</strong> </h2>
								   <p>If you see someone online who is suicidal, there are several steps you can take to help this person.</p>
								   <ul><li>Take his or her words seriously and respond with compassion.</li>
									<li>Encourage him or her to reach out for help to a friend, family member, counselor, clergy and other community members.</li>
									<li>Encourage him or her to call the&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/">National Suicide Prevention Hotline </a></strong>&nbsp;at (800) 273-TALK (8255). Tell him or her the Lifeline is available 24/7 for anyone in suicidal crisis anywhere in the United States.</li>
									<li>If you would like assistance, the Lifeline is also available to provide information about helping someone contemplating suicide. You can also visit the&nbsp;Lifeline&nbsp;website by clicking on the link above.</li>
									<li>If the person online is saying he or she is going to kill him or herself at that moment or is in the process of attempting suicide, please try to find the person's location and call the local police or 911.</li>
									</ul>
								   <h2  id="pub6"><strong>Do People Threaten Suicide to Get Attention?</strong> </h2>
								   <p>Suicidal thoughts or actions are a sign of extreme distress and an alert that someone needs help. Any warning sign or symptom of suicide should not be ignored. All talk of suicide should be taken seriously and requires attention. Threatening to die by suicide is not a normal response to stress and should not be taken lightly.
